# Synthetic Autonomous Driving Point-Cloud Data
This repo is a product of the Intelligent Robots Lab at the university of Kassel. Main focus is to work on [CARLA](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html). Building the bridge between those two technologies and creating synthetic multi lidar sensor vehicle datasets. 
We introduce a pipeline that include three parts:

- Configuration and recording of your experiment
- Post-processing that includes coordinate translation from world and sensor points of view into the ego perspective
- 3D Vizualization of your point-cloud data

## Package Demo
A short video that shows you how to generate one batch of synthetic point cloud data, post-process that data and visualize it.
